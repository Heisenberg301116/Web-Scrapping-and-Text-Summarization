{"link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "keywords": "Biodiversity", "summary": "India is a megadiverse country with high biological diversity and many endemic species. It is home to a significant percentage of mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, and flowering plant species. A third of Indian plant species are endemic, and it contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots.India's forest cover is 21.71% of the country's total land area, with very dense forest covering 3.02% of the land area, mainly in the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and Northeast India.Moderately dense forest covers 9.39% of India's land area, with the majority found in the Himalayas, eastern India, and central and southern India. Open forest covers 9.26% of India's land area. India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain.India has notable indigenous trees like neem and peepul, which are used in herbal medicine and have historical and religious significance.India's species have evolved from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent, and the collision with Eurasia led to a mass exchange of species.India has a high level of biodiversity, with many endemic species. However, volcanism and climatic changes caused the extinction of many species. Mammals entered India from Asia, which lowered endemism among mammals. Endemic species include the vulnerable hooded leaf monkey and the threatened Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats.India has 172 threatened animal species, including the Bengal tiger and Ganges river dolphin.Several species in India, including the gharial, great Indian bustard, and Indian white-rumped vulture, are critically endangered due to human encroachment and other factors. The blackbuck and Asiatic cheetah, once common in Punjab, are now extinct or severely endangered.The national park system was expanded significantly after being established in 1935.India has enacted laws and projects to protect wildlife and wilderness, including the Wildlife Protection Act, Project Tiger, and the Forest Conservation Act. There are over 500 wildlife sanctuaries and 13 biosphere reserves in India, with 4 being part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, and 25 wetlands registered under the Ramsar Convention.TL;DR stands for \"too long; didn't read\" and is used to summarize a lengthy piece of text or article."}
